# BladeBug_Triangulation
This repository includes Arduino Codes to measure round-trip Time of Flight (ToF) for radio waves between nRF24 and LoRa transceiver modules. It also includes a python code to find the distance of the robot on a turbine blade from the hub of the wind turbine using trigonometry and geometry. The report discusses different methods which can be used to make a localisation system for Wind Turbine Inspection Robots.
