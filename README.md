# BladeBug_Triangulation
This repository includes Arduino Codes to measure round-trip Time of Flight (ToF) for nRF24 and LoRa1278 radio transceiver modules. It also includes a python code which finds the distance of the robot on a turbine blade from the hub of the wind turbine using trigonometry and geometry, ie, Triangulation Algorithm. Another python code is used to generate random coordinates for the robots to simulate the Triangulation algorithm. The report discusses different methods which can be used to make a localisation system for Wind Turbine Inspection Robots.
